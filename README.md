# cityhop
Demo RESTful service using Spring Boot

**cityhop** determines whether two given cities are connected by known roads. It provides a single endpoint that answers the query, "Can I get from city A to city B?"

It uses its own database of cities and roads--i.e., a "known" road is a road known to *it*.
